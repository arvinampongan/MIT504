# Linear Discriminant Analysis


# Introduction
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), also known as Normal Discriminant Analysis or Discriminant Function Analysis, is a dimensionality reduction technique primarily utilized in supervised classification problems. 

# Origins and Development
LDA was originally developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936 as a method for distinguishing between two or more classes of objects or events. Fisher's work focused on creating a linear combination of features that maximizes the separation between classes while minimizing the variance within each class.

# Key Concepts and Applications
LDA operates under certain assumptions, such as the normal distribution of data and equal covariance among classes. It works by projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, allowing for easier classification. This dimensionality reduction is a significant advantage, particularly in scenarios with many features

# LDA has found applications in numerous domains

* Finance: It is used for bankruptcy prediction and risk assessment, helping to classify firms based on financial ratios and other variables.
* Healthcare: LDA enhances diagnostic accuracy by identifying patterns in patient data, which is critical for disease classification.
* Image Processing: The technique is employed in face recognition systems, where it reduces the number of features while retaining essential class discrimination information

 # Importance in data science and machine learning
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) plays a crucial role in data science and machine learning, primarily as a technique for classification and dimensionality reduction. Its importance can be summarized in several key aspects
  ### Classification and Dimensionality Reduction
* LDA is fundamentally a supervised learning algorithm that identifies a linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes. This capability is particularly useful in high-dimensional datasets, where it helps to reduce the number of features while retaining the essential information needed for classification.
  ### Maximizing Class Separability
* One of the core principles of LDA is to maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance. This approach ensures that the classes are as distinct as possible in the transformed feature space, which is critical for accurate classification
  ### Computational Efficiency
* LDA is computationally efficient and can perform well even when the number of features exceeds the number of observations. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in scenarios where data is abundant but high-dimensional, allowing for faster model training and evaluation.

 # Discriminant analysis vs. other classification methods
 LDA is a powerful classification technique that projects high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space to maximize class separability. While LDA assumes multivariate normality and equal covariance, making it less robust than methods like logistic regression when assumptions are violated, it remains a valuable tool in data science and machine learning.Compared to non-parametric methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), LDA requires distributional assumptions but can be computationally efficient. Decision trees and random forests offer more flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships and handling diverse data structures, but LDA remains a go-to choice for classification tasks when the underlying assumptions are met. The choice ultimately depends on the specific problem, data characteristics, and modeling goals.

 # Linear discriminants and decision boundaries
 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is characterized by its linear decision boundaries, which arise from the assumption that the features within each class follow a multivariate normal distribution with a common covariance matrix. The decision boundary is defined as the set of points where the posterior probabilities of two classes are equal, leading to a linear equation in the feature space. This linearity is a result of equating the discriminant functions of the classes, which can be expressed mathematically. In contrast to methods like Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), which allows for class-specific covariance matrices and thus can model non-linear boundaries, LDA's reliance on a single covariance structure across classes restricts it to linear decision boundaries. This makes LDA efficient for classification tasks where the assumptions hold, but less flexible in scenarios where the data distribution is more complex or non-linear

 # Linear discriminants and decision boundaries
* Normality: LDA assumes that the predictor variables are normally distributed within each class. This means that the distribution of the features for each class should follow a Gaussian distribution. If this assumption is violated, the performance of LDA can degrade, leading to inaccurate classification results.
*  Equal Covariance Matrices: LDA assumes that the covariance matrices of the different classes are equal. This homogeneity of variance means that the spread of the data points around the mean should be similar across all classes. If the covariance matrices differ significantly, the linear decision boundaries generated by LDA may not accurately reflect the underlying data structure, potentially leading to misclassification

# Mathematical Formulation
The objective function in LDA can be expressed as: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32225645-82be-4225-ac55-7be01915cbd0)

* Where J(w) is the objective function to be maximized.
* 𝑤 is the vector of weights (or coefficients) that defines the linear discriminant.
* SB​ is the between-class scatter matrix, which measures the variance between the different classes.
* SW​ is the within-class scatter matrix, which measures the variance within each class.

# Optimization Criterion
* The optimization criterion in LDA involves finding the vector w that maximizes the ratio of the between-class variance to the within-class variance. This approach ensures that the linear discriminant function effectively separates the classes in the feature space.
* To achieve this, LDA solves the generalized eigenvalue problem:
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe95d9a-1375-4457-9800-c817dc961fbe)

* where 𝜆 represents the eigenvalues. The optimal 𝑤 corresponds to the largest eigenvalue, leading to the best linear separation between classes.In summary, the objective function in LDA aims to maximize class separability by optimizing the ratio of between-class to within-class variance, facilitating effective classification.

# Deriving the discriminant functions
* To derive the discriminant functions in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we start with the goal of finding a linear combination of features that best separates different classes. The discriminant function for class k can be expressed as:
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a9126f2-e665-4c2b-96c1-2b8a5959a3c7)

* where: gk​(x) is the discriminant function for class 𝑘.
* 𝑤𝑘​ is the weight vector for class 𝑘k.
* 𝑥 is the feature vector.
* 𝑏𝑘​ is the bias term for class k.

# Derivation Steps
1. Assumptions: Assume that the data for each class 𝑘k follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean 𝜇𝑘 and a common covariance matrix Σ.
2. Discriminant Function: The discriminant function is derived from the likelihood of the data given the class. For a class 𝑘k, the likelihood can be expressed as:

3. Logarithm of the Likelihood: To simplify calculations, we take the logarithm of the likelihood

# Algorithm Workflow
Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Standardization
Data Cleaning: Handle any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in the dataset.
Standardization: Scale the features to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations, especially when they are on different scales.<br>
Step 2: Computing Class Means and Scatter Matrices
Class Means: Calculate the mean vector for each class: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a830ec6-2bb6-42d4-80ec-730cdd3ca096)

where 𝑁𝑘​ is the number of samples in class 𝑘 and 𝑥𝑖​ are the feature vectors.

# Algorithm Workflow
Overall Mean: Compute the overall mean of the dataset:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac90912-2e81-4559-8c8a-d19015aa3e7e)

where 𝐾 is the number of classes and 𝑁 is the total number of samples.<br>
Within-Class Scatter Matrix (S_W): Calculate the within-class scatter matrix, which measures the scatter of samples within each class:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c424b383-626f-462c-b36d-05990676a61c)

Between-Class Scatter Matrix (S_B): Calculate the between-class scatter matrix, which measures the scatter of the class means relative to the overall mean:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1af4e7-0a6d-4824-9240-54c9594899e4)

Step 3: Calculating Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
Eigenvalue Problem: Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e728f36b-2c5f-4cc0-bb65-92930d277a8f)

where 𝜆 represents the eigenvalues and 𝑤w represents the eigenvectors.<br>
Select Top Eigenvectors: Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top 𝑑 eigenvectors (where 𝑑 is the number of classes minus one) corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors form the basis of the new feature space.

Step 4: Projecting Data onto the Discriminant Components <br>
Projection: Transform the original data points into the new feature space defined by the selected eigenvectors:

Where
*Y is the matrix of projected data.
*𝑋X is the original data matrix.
*𝑊W is the matrix of selected eigenvectors

# Interpreting LDA Components
### Significance of Discriminant Components
* Dimensionality Reduction: The primary goal of LDA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while maximizing the separation between classes. 
* Class Separability: The discriminant components are designed to maximize the separation between classes. This means that the first discriminant component (usually the most important one) is chosen to maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance.
* Classification: The discriminant components are used to classify new data points. The classification rule is based on the distance of the new data point from the class means in the new subspace. 
* Interpretability: The discriminant components can be interpreted as the directions in the feature space that best separate the classes.

# Visualizing Discriminant Analysis results
One of the most common ways to visualize LDA results is to project the data onto the first two linear discriminants (LD1 and LD2) and create a 2D scatter plot. This allows you to see how well the classes are separated in the new 2D subspace.

A biplot is a way to visualize both the samples and the variables in the same plot. It can be created by projecting both the data and the feature vectors onto the first two principal components or linear discriminants.

A confusion matrix can be used to visualize the performance of the LDA classifier on a test set. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.

# Limitations
* Sensitivity to Outliers: LDA is sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data. Outliers can significantly affect the estimation of the class means and covariance matrices, leading to poor discriminant functions and classification performance.
* Assumption of Normal Distribution: LDA assumes that the features within each class follow a multivariate normal distribution. If this assumption is violated, the performance of LDA can degrade. 
* Assumption of Equal Covariance Matrices: LDA assumes that the covariance matrices of the different classes are equal. This homogeneity of variance means that the spread of the data points around the mean should be similar across all classes.
* Curse of Dimensionality: When the number of features is large compared to the number of samples, LDA can suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In high-dimensional spaces, the data becomes sparse, making it difficult to estimate the covariance matrices accurately.
Inability to Model Non-linear Boundaries: LDA constructs linear decision boundaries between classes.

# LDA in Technology Project Management
* Project Planning and Risk Management - LDA can be used to classify projects based on historical data, aiding in risk assessment and decision-making. By projecting the high-dimensional project data onto a lower-dimensional space, LDA can help identify the most discriminative features that separate projects with different risk profiles
* Quality Assurance -  In software development projects, LDA can be applied to classify defects or issues, improving quality control processes.
* Customer Segmentation - LDA can be used to segment customers based on their behavior or preferences, helping in tailored project deliverables. 
* Performance Analysis - LDA can be applied to analyze team performance data and identify patterns contributing to project success.

# Implementation process
* Data Collection: The first step is to gather relevant project management data for analysis. This may include data from various sources
* Data Preprocessing : Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and prepared for LDA. This may involve:
  * Handling missing values (e.g., imputation, removal)
  * Removing irrelevant or redundant features
  * Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)
  * Scaling the features to have zero mean and unit variance  
  * Proper data preprocessing is crucial for the success of the LDA algorithm.
* Applying LDA Algorithm
  * To implement LDA using software tools, follow these steps:
    * Load the preprocessed data: Import the cleaned and preprocessed data into your software environment (e.g., Python, R).
    * Split the data: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the LDA model.
    * Initialize and fit the LDA model: Create an instance of the LDA model and fit it to the training data.
    * Project the data: Project the training and testing data onto the LDA discriminants to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
    * Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the LDA model on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
  * Interpreting Results
    * After applying LDA, it's essential to interpret the results and make data-driven decisions. This may involve:
    * Visualizing the projected data to understand the patterns and trends
    * Identifying the most discriminative features that separate the project classes
    * Assessing the performance of the LDA model on the testing set
    * Applying the trained LDA model to classify new projects or predict their risk profiles
The interpretation of results should be done in the context of the specific project management problem and the business objectives.
